# Transparency Log Threads

Issue tracking GitHub repository for squad members and community maintainers on RFC voting, moderation actions and other actions that may affect the organization and its community.

## How this works?

Similar to delegate communication threads in Arbitrum governance forum,
you make a new thread for logging your votes in the RTSIP process,
transparently publish any moderator actions you taken and other tasks
that may affect @recaptime-dev and the community as whole.

In our implementation of this, we lock issues to avoid spam and
unnecessary discussions but you can still reply as long as you are
direct contributor with triage access via
@recaptime-dev/transparency-log-threads team.
